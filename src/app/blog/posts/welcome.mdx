## Introduction

I have been programming and trying out different open sourced frameworks for over 7 years now. In that time span, I have had the thought of creating a personal website about a million times.

Till now the issue had always been that simplistic and minimalistic websites looked like they were remnants of the late 90's websites. The offerings on the other end of the spectrum were always so convoluted that they require a lot of reading into the documentation and debugging to get them to work or were all paid offerings. 

So you can imagine my surprise when I ran across Once UI completely by chance as I sat down to make my website from scratch. The UI was everything I wanted from the smooth animations to the brief but well-documented code.

I was able to pick up the framework, start a new GitHub repository, buy a domain, and get 80-90% functional within 3 hours, where 2 hours were spent waiting for the domain to become recognizable on the DNS.
