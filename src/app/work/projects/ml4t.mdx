## Project Overview

As part of my coursework at Georgia Tech, I set out to design and evaluate algorithmic trading
strategies—essentially, getting a computer to make smart buy and sell decisions in the stock
market. This project wasn’t about chasing the next “get rich quick” scheme, but about
understanding how data-driven systems work in unpredictable, real-world environments.
My goal was to compare two fundamentally different approaches: one based on classic
trading rules, and the other leveraging machine learning.

What made this project especially valuable was the hands-on integration of software engineering,
quantitative analysis, and critical thinking. I designed modular indicator functions to enable
experimentation, created unified interfaces for both strategy types, and developed a flexible
market simulator for realistic testing. This experience reinforced the importance of both 
clear understanding of problems (explaining the “why” behind each approach) and
rigorous testing practices before trusting any automated system.

## Key Concepts: Making Sense of Market Data

To guide trading decisions, I built a set of tools that calculated **technical indicators**.
These indicators are already widely used in finance and help showcase volume and momentum 
movements in the market. For example:

- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** and **Double EMA (DEMA):** These track price trends across
different time intervals, making it easier to spot momentum shifts.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** This indicator helps highlight when
market momentum is building or fading by comparing fast and slow price trends.
- **Bollinger Bands:** These create “boundaries” around typical price ranges at a set standard
 deviation, highlighting when prices are unusually high or low.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** A score that indicates whether a stock might be
 overbought or oversold, offering clues about potential turning points.

By integrating these indicators, I gave my algorithms the ability to “see” patterns that
 traders often use as cues for action.

## Manual vs. Machine Learning Approaches

The first strategy I implemented was completely rule-based. I used the technical indicators
to code the trading heuristics. For example, buying when a stock appears undervalued based on
multiple indicators, and selling when it seems overextended. The main strength here is
transparency, you always know *why* a decision is being made.
But, these rules can struggle with market complexity and subtle patterns and this is also what
was noticed in the In-Sample and the Out-of-Sample testing.

The second strategy was the model-based approach. I developed a machine learning system to
analyze historical data, discover relationships among indicators, and generate its own buy
and sell signals. This model doesn’t rely on any single rule but instead learns from data
to adapt its decisions as conditions change. The system uses ensemble learning methods
(multiple decision trees combined). By not just relying on a single decision tree, I could
boost the trust factor that multiple decision trees all trained on different subsets of the 
training data all averaged out to one decision.

## Experimentation and Results

To compare the performance of both strategies, I ran a series of backtests using historical 
real market data on the J.P. Morgan ($JPM) stock ticker, simulating not just profits and losses but also real-world constraints 
like transaction fees and market impact. In particular, the In-Sample data (the data that was trained on)
was from Jan 1st, 2008 to Dec 31st, 2009. Covering a period of massive volatility in the market
due to the Great Recession. The Out-of-Sample tests were conducted on data from Jan 1st, 2010 to 
Dec 31st 2011. A period of time where the economy was recovering from the period of uncertainity.

I found that the machine learning approach typically outperformed the manual rule-based 
strategy, especially in more volatile markets. However, once I factored in trading costs on Out-of-Sample data, 
the results flipped showing that even advanced algorithms need to account for the practical 
realities of trading and not assume that investors have unlimited bankrolls.

## Future Contributions

If I were to extend this work, I would explore alternative features, such as trading volume 
or sentiment data, and evaluate more advanced learning algorithms. I have a backlogged side-project
that will take the concepts of this project one step further and implement it using [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/)
for real money trading including baking in concepts about options trading and more granular
strategies for trading besides buy-hold patterns.
 
 Also, being that government and policy decisions are large motivators for the markets, 
 I would want to introduce an Agentic AI system that can consider Tweets, news articles,
 and any trending items to help guide decisions. This could be a nice indicator to have to tell
 how the market is feeling about new information.
