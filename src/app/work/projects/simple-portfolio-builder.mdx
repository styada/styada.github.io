## Introduction

Here is my work pertaining to my mathematics thesis on Solving Ill-Posed Inverse Problems with Computerized Reconstruction Approaches!

The work rotates around using computerized reconstruction through neural networks to learn how to denoise medical tomographic imagery. 
The mathematics of the problem is posed as an ill-posed inverse problem. That is to say that, we have the noisy output from the CT machine, how can we calculate the inverse of this non-standard and unique output to get a cleaner picture?
